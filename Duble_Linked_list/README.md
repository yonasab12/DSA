A doubly linked list is a more complex data structure than a singly linked list, but it offers several advantages.
 The main advantage of a doubly linked list is that it allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions.

 This is because each node in the list contains a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the next node.
 This allows for quick and easy insertion and deletion of nodes from the list, as well as efficient traversal of the list in both directions.

               What is a Doubly Linked List?
      A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes, each of which contains a value and two pointers, one pointing to the previous node in the list and one pointing to the next node in the list. This allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions, making it suitable for applications where frequent insertions and deletions are required.

                Representation of Doubly Linked List in Data Structure
       In a data structure, a doubly linked list is represented using nodes that have three fields:

                 #Data
                 #A pointer to the next node (next)
                 #A pointer to the previous node (prev)
